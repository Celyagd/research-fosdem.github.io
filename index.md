# Join us at FOSDEM 2020
## Saturday 1st of February 2020<br> from 10:30 to 19:00<br>AW1.126, ULB, Brussels, Belgium

We invite **developers or users of tools and technologies** used in a research context to attend our devroom at the [FOSDEM 2020](https://fosdem.org) conference.
We understand research as the general process to produce knowledge such as **scientific research, investigative journalism, NGOs fieldwork**, etc.




**Submissions are now closed**

# The Open Research Technologies devroom

The Open Research Technologies devroom addresses [FLOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) developers in a broad community concerned with research production and curation: scientists, engineers, journalists, archivists, curators, activists.
The tools and technologies targeted are typically creating, handling or sharing knowledge artifacts: data, academic papers, books, collections, web contents, algorithms, artworks.
This devroom provides a place and time to discuss the issues related to the creation and usage of open research technologies, with the ambition to foster discussions between designers, developers and users, bridging multiple knowledge-based communities together, and with the broader FLOSS community.

The Open Research Technologies devroom aims to:
- Allow knowledge-based tool developers to publicize their effort and become aware of other FLOSS projects.
- Facilitate the pooling of coding efforts on (often poorly funded) tools.
- Create a network where otherwise isolated developers, research engineers can share common FLOSS concerns.
- Provide social recognition for people who work in fields where designing and developing tools is less considered than usual outcomes (e.g. not publishing papers in research, not writing investigation in data journalism, etc).

# What is FOSDEM?

The FOSDEM (Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting) is a non-commercial, volunteer-organized European event centered on free and open-source software development. It is aimed at developers and anyone interested in the free and open-source software movement. It aims to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open-source software.

# Other devrooms might interest you

Even if the FOSDEM is not science-specific, you might be interested by many other talks. Some developer rooms have a scope that resonates with research, for instance:
- [HPC, Big Data, and Data Science](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/hpc_big_data_and_data_science/)
- [Graph systems and algorithms](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/graph_systems_and_algorithms/)
- [Open source design](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/open_source_design/)
- [Community](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/community_devroom/)

Of course you will also be able to find high quality talks in your own area of expertise in the [50+ devrooms](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/) (Python, Java, Rust, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Finally, you may appreciate the prestigious keynotes in the main amphitheater *(to be announced)*.

Paul and Mathieu were colleagues at Sciences Po médialab.
Achilleas and Michael are colleagues at the German Neuroinformatics Node.
We met because we submitted two very related "Open Science" proposals for FOSDEM 2020!
